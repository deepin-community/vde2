Description: Virtual Distributed Ethernet
 VDE is a virtual switch that can connect multiple virtual machines together,
 both local and remote.
 .
 Components of the VDE architecture are VDE switches (virtual counterpart of
 ethernet switches) and VDE cables (virtual counterpart of a crossed-cable used
 to connect two switches).
 .
 VDE 2 includes:
  - switch management both from console and from a "unix socket terminal"
  - VLAN 801.1q
  - FSTP (fast spanning tree)
  - distributed cable manager using a blowfish encrypted channel
 .
 Examples of VDE uses:
  - With VDE it is possible to create a virtual network of QEMU machines
    running on several real computer
  - VDE can be used to create tunnels (even crossing masqueraded networks)
  - VDE can provide mobility support
 .
 The VDE also provides bi-directional pipe command (dpipe) and remote terminal
 for unix sockets (unixterm).
 .
 The Debian package provides a nice extension for /etc/network/interfaces file
 for easy set up.
